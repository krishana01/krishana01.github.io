										<h3>The Problem</h3>
										<p>Adopting is a complicated and drawn out process. It can be heartbreaking to fall in love with a pet and then realize you don’t meet the requirements or the pet isn’t a good lifestyle fit.</p>
										<li>Users struggle during the adoption process due to a lack of clarity of content and missing information.</li>
										<li>An improved SPCA website could lead to user success. </li>
										<li>Success could be measured by an increase in customers submitting adoption forms. </li>
										</ul>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ethno.png" alt="" /></a>
										<ul>
										<h3>User Insight</h3>
										<p>What does the research from user research tell us?</p>
										<li>Users need more details about the adoption process at the beginning of this process.</li>
										<li>They need information about potential pets so they can determine if the pet will be a good fit with their lifestyle. </li>
										<li>This information is necessary so they can make an informed decision.</li>
										</ul>
										<ul>
										<h3>Research Data - Empathize</h3>
										<p>Once interviews had been completed, our team synthesized the results into an affinity diagram. We noted the following of our findings.</p>	
										<li>Users were confused by the adoption process and weren’t sure of next steps.</li>
										<li>66% of users surveyed said pet adoption sites did a poor job providing the information they need. </li>
										<li>Some users reported that the FAQ was cumbersome and that information was not organized well, leading to a long scrolling experience.</li>
										<li>Users felt that it was difficult to find available pets and disliked that you are taken to an external site. </li>
										</ul>

											<h3>The Goal</h3>
												<p>Providing prospective pet owners with clarity on the adoption process as well as necessary information 
													about adoption requirements and pet traits. Ensuring that users interested in adopting have a clear idea
													of next steps, requirements, and all pets available for adoption.</p>

											<h3>Future Development</h3>
											<p>From a linking perspective, the Greater Charlotte SPCA is a simple website. However, as we dug further, we found that the adoption process could become overwhelming amd convoluted without clear definition and user experience kept at the forefront.</p>
											<h3>UI Style Tile</h3>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Group 173.png" alt="" /></a>
											<p>The SPCA provides resources to users hoping to adopt a dog, as well as anybody interested in donating or fostering pets. 

												It’s important for the site to feel welcoming and to provide information without feeling overwhelming. The colors and font choices should feel peaceful. 
												
												We chose to use rounded edges for much of our iconography and formatting so that the site wouldn’t feel harsh. 
												</p>
											<h3>Lo + Mid-Fi Wireframe</h3>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/lospca.png" alt="" /></a>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/midspca.png" alt="" /></a>
											
											<p>For our A/B usability testing, we interviewed several classmates as well two group family members. </p>
											<p>Some helpful feedback that we received was that the flow of our page could be reconfigured to help draw users down the page and through the adoption funnel. We also learned that some of linking in our first module felt duplicative because it was so close to the header, leading to us changing the verbiage. </p>
											<p>Our A/B testing gave us an opportunity to test the updated flow of our homepage (a learning from usability testing) with some classmates. Unanimously, the testing participants preferred Homepage B, so we moved forward with that architecture. </p>
											<h3>User Persona</h3>
											<p>With the insight gained through our interviews and affinity diagram, we were able 
											to create a user persona that accurately reflects a potential user. </p>
											<li>Our interviews indicated that users struggled to understand the steps in the adoption process and were unclear about the requirements. </li>
											<li>We nodded to users’ difficulties in finding the right pet for their lifestyle with Kyle’s main difficulty being that he had a hard time learning about the specific pet’s traits. </li>
