											<h3>Final Prototype</h3>
											<p>The final protototype addressed and updated the app with the users’ feedback. </p>
											<h3>Updates</h3>
											<ul>
											<li>Develop the mobile version of site to make it as responsive as desktop version</li>
											<li>Survey therapists to see what perspective they have on youth mental health access and how FYS can contribute</li>
											<li>Further usability testing on hi-fi versions of both desktop and mobile sites</li>
											<li>Community aspects and group care</li>
											<li>Billing and settings pieces</li>
											</ul>
											<h3>The Problem</h3>
										<p>Half of all mental health conditions start by age 14, but most cases are undetected and untreated</p>
										<i>Madeofmillions.com/stats </i>
										
										<h3>The Solution</h3>
										<p>Our overall concept stems from an apparent desperate need to give youth aged 12-19 access to mental health resources. More than a third of students surveyed responded that they don’t feel like they have an adult they can go to for help. More than a third of respondents said they would just Google for assistance in finding mental health resources, rather than go to someone personally they know. About one quarter of students said that one major roadblock for them seeking therapy is that they doubt it would help them at all.
											22 actual respondents all ages 12-18.</p>
										<h3>Impact Statement</h3>
										<p>Inform teens and young adults under 19 of mental health options, as well as resources to information and therapy.</p>
										
										<h3>Mid Fi Wireframes</h3>
										<p>Here are some screens of our mid-fi prototypes. We did do some usability testing and 
												some feedback from initial tests prompted us to make the “call to action” more 
												friendly and engaging – originally it was just a fact about mental health. We also 
												eliminated a lot of white space from around some of the icons. We made the social 
												media links mono-chromatic so they weren’t so glaring. The “connect with therapist” 
												piece was turned into a carousel image.
											</p>

											</ul>

										<h3> Site Mapping </h3>
										<p>One key element of the site mapping was an attempt to standardize the 
											language used to refer to different pieces of the site. The resource 
											is called “For Your Self” so we wanted to integrate similar pronoun 
											usage like “My” into “My Care” and “My Settings”, which also helps to 
											create ownership and responsibility into the care process. User flow 
											indicates path of least resistance – how would a user go about getting 
											help as quickly as possible? We ultimately integrated this thought process
											 into a “step 1, step 2, step 3” piece right on the home page as a further 
											 “call to action” for users.

									<h3>UI Style Tile</h3>
										<p>When creating the UI style, we wanted an overall feel of trustworthiness and positive energy. 
											Original iterations of the color palette wound up being extremely ugly in practice 
											(a weird avocado green shade that came across very dated and unpleasant). In some parts of 
											the prototypes, we even wound up tinting and overlapping some of these hues to create cohesion. 
											For UI imagery, we used image creators like StorySet and Canva, which allowed us to import our own 
											hex values to make vector images.</p>
									<h3>Color Palette + Images</h3>
									<p>Muted colors in modern but still comforting, accessible hues.Colors were also used with varied tints, as we overlapped some transparent design elements to create cohesion between sections
										(Accessibility analysis showed poor feedback and contrast). Images were created using storySet and Canva.
										</p>
